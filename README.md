In this assignment, our goal is to develop a neural network capable of accurately classifying tree species within the university garden. The importance of this task lies in understanding and preserving the biodiversity of our natural environment. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to enhance our ability to identify and differentiate tree species based on specific features of leaves.
